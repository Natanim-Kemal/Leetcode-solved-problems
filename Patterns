## Pattern based learning on leetcode problems

There are few patterns 
### How to Solve Problems by Watching Patterns on Leetcode

1. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - Read the problem carefully and try to relate it to a known pattern (e.g., sliding window, two pointers, binary search, dynamic programming, backtracking, etc.).
   - Look for keywords or constraints that hint at a specific approach.

2. **Review Similar Problems:**
   - Search for problems with similar patterns on Leetcode.
   - Study their solutions and understand the underlying logic.

3. **Break Down the Problem:**
   - Divide the problem into smaller parts that fit the identified pattern.
   - Write pseudocode or outline the steps before coding.

4. **Implement the Solution:**
   - Apply the pattern to solve the problem.
   - Test with sample inputs and edge cases.

5. **Practice and Reflect:**
   - Solve multiple problems of the same pattern to reinforce your understanding.
   - Reflect on mistakes and optimize your approach.

By consistently watching for patterns and practicing, you can solve Leetcode problems more efficiently and improve your problem-solving skills.
